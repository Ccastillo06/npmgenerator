Dear Ironahck student...are you tired of looking for the npm packages to install before starting a project?

No problem! Use this app to generate the commands needed to start working!

How to use it?

Easy! Check the boxes of the packages you want to install and click the button... BOOM! You now have two lines:
 - The first one is used to start an express project already configured with the basics (dont't forget the npm i after that!)
 - The second line is used to install all the packages you ckecked (ouh yeah!).
